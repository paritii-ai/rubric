# Rubric: AI Equity Rubric Guidelines for Developers
# Pre-Development Considerations
# Infrastructure Assessment:
An organization seeking to build or implement an AI/ML system needs to conduct an infrastructure assessment to determine what they need to successfully build an AI/ML system. The infrastructure model consists of hardware and software components that are necessary for building and training AI models. Components such as specialized processors like GPUs (hardware) and optimization and deployment tools (software) fall under the infrastructure umbrella [1]. The following considerations will help organizations and developers navigate the process. 
# Organizations
1.	Big Data Storage: 
This refers to the ability to scale storage as the volume of data grows. The ability to handle storage should be a high priority.  This includes ensuring the proper storage capacity, Input/Output Operations per sec (IOPS) and reliability to deal with the massive data amounts required for effective AI [2]. One important factor to consider is the nature of the source data. AI applications depend on source data, so an organization needs to know where the source data resides and how AI applications will use it [2]. Organizations also need to put in place plans for monitoring and expansion as databases grow over time. Consider Cloud or On-premises solutions. Organizations must decide whether to adopt a cloud-based AI/ML solution or develop an on-premises infrastructure. 
2.	Networking Infrastructure:
The network infrastructure is a key component of the AI/ML system implementation process. To provide the high efficiency at scale required to support AI and machine learning models, organizations will likely need to upgrade their networks [2]. Optimal network infrastructure should have the following key attributes of high-bandwidth, low-latency and elastic architectures that can respond flexibly to computing needs. 
3.	Computing Resources:
It is imperative to have robust computing resources by deciding on the right mix of CPU and GPU chips. CPU-based compute units work best for light AI/ML loads while GPU -based compute units work best for advanced AI/ML workloads and neural network computing [2]. 
4.	Data Management and Governance:
Data management strategy needs to ensure that users -- machines and people -- have easy and fast access to data and it should be accessible from a variety of endpoints, including mobile devices via wireless networks [2]. Privacy and security controls need to be implemented for data access controls to comply with legal regulations about data and privacy protection. Develop a robust data governance framework that outlines data collection, storage, usage, and protection practices. Address privacy, security, and ethical concerns associated with AI/ML adoption [3]

# Developers
5.	Define Clear Objectives:
 Clearly articulate the business objectives you aim to achieve through AI/ML implementation. Identify specific problems or opportunities that can be addressed effectively using these technologies [3]
6.	Evaluate Data Availability and Quality: 
Assess the availability, quality, and relevance of your organization's data. Ensure that you have enough high-quality data to train AI models and derive meaningful insights [3]
7.	Establish Data Governance Framework:
 Develop a stringent data governance framework that outlines data collection, storage, usage, and protection practices. Address privacy, security, and ethical concerns associated with AI/ML adoption [3]
8.	Assess Infrastructure and Resources: 
Evaluate your organization's existing IT infrastructure and computing resources. Determine if you have the necessary hardware, software, and storage capabilities to support AI/ML workloads effectively depending on the application/s been considered [3]
